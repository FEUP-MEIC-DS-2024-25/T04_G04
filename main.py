        * ðŸ”’ "Previously registered" was added for greater clarity.
        
        **Additional Considerations:**

        * **Detailed Specifications:** Requirements can be enriched with more details, such as the specific functionality of search (for example, whether the search is for exact matches or keywords).
        * **Prioritization:** It is important to define the priority of each requirement so that the development team can focus on the most important features.
        * **Testing:** For each requirement, test scenarios should be defined to ensure that the functionality works as expected.


        **General Improvements:**

        * Clearer and more concise language;
        * Greater accuracy in defining requirements;
        * Consideration of important details.
