**Requirement 1:** The application must load within 3 seconds on a standard network connection. ⏱️

**Comments:**
* ✅ Improved clarity by specifying a timeframe.
* ➕ Added a performance metric (3 seconds) for better testability.

**Requirement 2:** The application must use OAuth 2.0 for user authentication. 🔑

**Comments:**
* ✅ This requirement is well-defined and clear.

**Requirement 3:** The system must support secure payment integration via [Specify Payment Gateways, e.g., Stripe, PayPal]. 💳

**Comments:**
* ✅ Improved by specifying payment gateway(s) for clarity and implementation feasibility.
* ➕  Added specificity to make the requirement testable.

**Requirement 4:** The system must be able to handle a high volume of concurrent users (Specify minimum number, e.g., 1000). 🧑‍💻🧑‍💻🧑‍💻

**Comments:**
* ✅ "Unlimited" is unrealistic.  Replacing with a quantifiable target.
* ➕ Added a specific number for better testing and scalability planning.

**Requirement 5:** The AI tool must dynamically adapt its semantic models to understand requirements from diverse domains.  This adaptation should occur without explicit user intervention. 🤖

**Comments:**
* ✅ Split the overly complex requirement into a more manageable one.  The "actionable insights" aspect is addressed in a separate, subsequent requirement.
* ➕ Focus is now on the core functionality of dynamic adaptation.

**Requirement 6:** The AI tool must provide actionable insights based on its understanding of the requirements.  These insights should be presented in a clear and concise manner. 💡

**Comments:**
* ✅  This requirement isolates the actionable insight generation from the model adaptation, making it clearer and more testable.
* ➕ Added a requirement for clear presentation of insights.

**Requirement 7:** The system must implement robust security measures, including but not limited to: data encryption at rest and in transit, regular security audits, and protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting). 🔒🛡️

**Comments:**
* ✅  "The system must be secure" is too vague.  This provides specific examples.
* ➕ Added concrete security measures for better implementation and testing.



**Additional Considerations:**

* **Detailed Specifications:**  For all requirements, detailed specifications, including acceptance criteria, are crucial for successful implementation and testing.
* **Prioritization:**  The requirements should be prioritized based on business value and technical feasibility.  MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) method is recommended.
* **Testing:**  Comprehensive test cases should be developed for each requirement to ensure functionality, performance, and security.  This includes unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
